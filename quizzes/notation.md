# Command notation

Command notation is used throughout the QuizBot documentation.

Whenever you see a command which looks like this: `=command <argument> (argument)` there are some things to be aware of:

- `=` is the common QuizBot prefix which can be changed on a per-server basis. If your server uses a different prefix, use that instead of the '='. You can see your server prefix by mentioning the bot in a channel: @QuizBot
- `<>` shows a required argument. You need to include this or else the command will not run correctly.
- `()` shows an optional argument. You may want to include this to add additional information but the command will usually still function without.

**You do not need to include the `<>` or `()` characters when running a command, the bot knows what you are trying to do!**
