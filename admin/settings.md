# Changing server settings

## Prefix

QuizBot allows you to set a custom prefix for your server. Type `=settings prefix` followed by your new prefix.

Forgot your server's prefix? Ping the bot and it will respond with it.

There is one limitation to your server's prefix: it cannot be longer than 24 characters.

## Language

QuizBot is currently available in two languages: English and German.

To change the language, run `=settings language <en/de>`

## Command specific permissions

You can modify access levels per-command with the `=access-level` command.

To set a command access level, use `=access-level set <command> <role|permission>`

To clear a command access level, use `=access-level reset <command>`
